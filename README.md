# NoveUpdates-reading-list-exporter

A simple chrome extension that exports all Novel Updates reading lists of the currently logged in user to a json file. 

For it to work, you must be logged into a Novel Updates account and the location of the active tab must be a part of www.novelupdates.com (the forums will not work). 
To start the export, you just have to click the extension icon and confirm that you want to export all your reading lists.
